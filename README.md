# Observables

* Average Math scores & Math passing rates across the schools are slightly worse than the ones for Reading.
   * And this pattern holds true for every single school in the sample.
   * Such similarity across all of the schools doesn't seem to be a matter of randomness, more probably, there's an underlying systemic causality behind this state.
   * I would guess that the narrow gap in average Math and Reading scores in within the schools could be explained by some natural convergence of student skills towards the average; or maybe the convergence of the graders.
   
* Quite surprising to me was to find out that the budget per student isn't positively correlated with the scores. Actually, it's the opposite. The more money the school has, the worse scores they tend to have.
    * I wonder what's the causality direction here. I assume that if everything holds constant, the more money school has, the better outcomes it would drive. Seeing the opposite probably means that there are other uneven factors affecting either the budget allocation per school or the student outcomes.
        * Maybe, "at risk schools" are being subsidised with more money?
        
* Less surprising was to see that the smaller schools tend to perform better than the large ones.
